Seismogeodesy is a new subcommission under the joint umbrella of IAG and IASPEI.

See the [terms of reference](/presentation/tor/) for a full description of the subcommission objectives.


It aims at:

* actively encourage the cooperation between all geoscientists studying the plate boundary deformation zones, by promoting the exploitation of synergies between different fields;

* to reinforce collocated and integrated geodetic and seismological monitoring of seismically active areas by increasing and/or developing infrastructures dedicated to broadband observations from the seismic wave band to the permanent displacement;

* to promote the application to earthquake and deformation studies of innovative technologies such as optical fibers

* to be a reference group for the integration of the most advanced geodetic and seismological techniques by developing consistent methodologies for data reduction, analysis, integration, and interpretation;

* to act as a forum for discussion and scientific support for international geoscientists investigating the kinematics and mechanics of the plate boundary deformation zone;

* to promote the use of standard procedures for geodetic data acquisition, quality evaluation, and processing, particularly GNSS data and InSAR data;

* to promote earthquake geodesy, the study of seismically active regions with large earthquake potential, and geodetic application to early warning system of earthquakes and tsunamis for hazard mitigation;

* to promote the role of geodesy in tectonic studies for understanding the seismic cycle, transient and instantaneous deformation, and creeping versus seismic slip on faults.

* to facilitate and stimulate the integrated exploitation of large geodetic and seismological data sets, using Machine Learning and Data Mining approaches

It is part of commission 3 [Commission 3: Earth Rotation and Geodynamics](https://com3.iag-aig.org/)
