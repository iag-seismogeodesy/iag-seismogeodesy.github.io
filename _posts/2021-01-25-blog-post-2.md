For now 40 years, WEGENER gathers Geoscientists wishing to cooperate on the application of geodesy to the study of the geodynamics in the Alpineâ€“Mediterranean plate boundary. The XXth assembly is planned to be organized in Marrakech, Morocco, 25-29 October 2021. If the sanitary situation would not allow travel to Marrakech, on-line meeting would be organized. Final decision will be made by mid-June.  

Proposed sessions include new methodology in geodetic observation and analysis, integration of of geodetic, tectonic and seismological data to better understand earthquakes and the earthquake cycle, potential fields, intracontinental deformation, volcanoes, glacier, lanslide processes. Training courses in GNSS, InSAR, Active Tectonics and Modeling we be organized for students before the meeting. The WEGENER assembly will be organized under the umbrella of the new joint IAG-IASPEI subcommission 3.5 "Seismogeodesy".
